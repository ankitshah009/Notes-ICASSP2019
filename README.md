# About me

I am Sai Krishna Rallabandi, a PhD student in Language Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. The views expressed in these notes are based on my understanding/misunderstanding of the concepts I care about. Please take them with a grain of salt.

I am roughly dividing these notes into the following:

* **Paradigms**: These are things that I feel are receiving a lot of attention right now. They also have the potential to be first class objects across applications. Ideally I would expect myself to have a good grasp of fundamentals of paradigms. Examples of paradigms are: Variational Inference and Adversarial Training. 
* **Trends:** These are things that have potential to become paradigms in the future.
* **Building Blocks:** These refer to things that form legos in our deep learning architectures. This category is subdivided into layers, blocks, modules and optimization for easier analysis \(inspired by 'groves' in Warren Buffet's [Annual Report 2018](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2018ar/2018ar.pdf)\).
